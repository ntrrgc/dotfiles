Usage: build-type [<release|debug|unset>]

Get or set the default build mode to use in this project.

You can use this value in other scripts instead of using environment variables.
By doing it this way you avoid accidentally running commands from history on
the wrong type of build, as usually happens with WebKit scripts.
