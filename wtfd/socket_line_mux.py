    Stack UNIX socket line multiplexer. 

    This program listens on a UNIX socket where zero or more clients (publishers)
    can connect and send data delimited by the newline character. Each publisher
    has may have a "current line": the last newline delimited string it has send
    to the multiplexer.
    
    The multiplexer also has a global current line, defined as the current line
    of the most recent alive publisher.
    
    Clients of the Subscribe socket (subscribers) receive the current line of
    the multiplexer when they connect and every time it changes.
    
    The current line may be null if there is currently no alive publisher that
    has written a line. In that case new subscriber clients receive no data
    until a line is published later. 
    
    If the current line of the server, while being not null, is later lost due 
    to the disconnection of a publisher, then the subscribers receive a newline
    character.
    
    This program forks: a child keeps working on the background while the parent
    process exits after the socket is bound and listening.
