wtfd: A bar feeder
==================

This is my [lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) feeder, intended to be used with [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm). It's the small program that is piped to lemonbar and generates all the data that is shown.

It listens for changes in the desktop environment, such as windows opened or closed, changes in the focused window title and the system volume and updates accordingly.

It has also a [Wanikani](https://www.wanikani.com/) widget to remember me to do my kanji reviews.

Some highlights of this bar feeder:

 * Very few cases of process spawning.
 * Intended for use with dual monitors.
 * No polling. Except for the Wanikani widget, since they have no push API. Every other thing is only checked in response to events:
    * [xtitle](https://github.com/baskerville/xtitle) is used to track the focused window title.
    * `bspc subscribe` is used to track changes in windows opened, closed or focused.
        * `bspc wm --dump-state` is called after every change to get the current desktop tree (used to render the virtual desktop widgets). This is the only case in `wtfd` where subprocess are created after initialization.
    * [pulse-volume-monitor](https://github.com/ntrrgc/pulse-volume-monitor) is used for the volume widget.
    * System time is scheduled to be checked only after the exact time needed for the current minute to end passes.
 * Written in Python 3, using Tornado instead of Bash.
 * No threads.

Note: wtfd is not intended to be reusable so it has no configuration, just code, everything here; it's something I made just for my own use. That said, if you find some parts useful or inspiring, copy and change as much as you want.
